# Quadrea-of-Projective-Quadrilateral

I created 5 videos on the topic of exploring the quadrea of the projective quadrilateral.

Part 0 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rduoy5skEQo

Part 1 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1aAamqeTIw

Part 2 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLKon1_3Lo8

Part 3 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0MbUg5T9Jo

Part 4 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR1ubhVd6aU

The presentations in the videos Part 1 to Part 4 were created using Microsoft Whiteboard, and they were exported as SVG files and saved in this repository. The part 0 video was created using Microsoft OneNote . I also included two jupyter notebooks where I do calculations in python of the Exemplary Transformations for projective triangles and projective quadrilaterals.

For background reference material see the main laws from Universal Hyperbolic Geometry in the Hyperbolic and Elliptic (Spherical) settings.
